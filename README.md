<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? </span>

In order to interpret user needs, I can gather some important users with experince with that product or similar product and asked them for their feedback and stories. A very diverse group of users is also very important in order to make a great product for everyone out there. An 18 year old might have different needs and stories from a 30 year old adult. Therefore is is really good when the stories of the users are well diversed in order to make the product usable for everyone that might want to use it. Once I collect all the data from the user stories, I can see which featuttures where theh most important and start working on them first. Once I have a program running, I can then ask for more feedback about the code.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are several approaches one can take on a developing programs. Two popular approcahes are Waterfall methodology and Agile methodology. Waterfall is good for small projects however it has some cons and this is when Agile exceeds. Some agile processes that should incorporate into future development work are Scrum events, Project planning, Sprint planning, Sprint review and retrospective and more.
